# Budgeting :: A Modern React, Redux, React Router 4, Webpack Sample App

![React, Redux, Router, Webpack, Sass](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/733074/25338311/193a1a40-28ff-11e7-8f22-9a5d9dac7b84.png)

Production-ready React + Webpack architecture implemented on consumer web apps of some of the most successful enterprises in the world. Perceived performance and development experience are key factors in this setup. You can use this code base for learning or to scaffold your mission-critical project.

[See live demo](https://budgeting-a937b.firebaseapp.com/).

## Budgeting Application
The is a simple budget management application. It tracks inflow and outflow, shows remaining budget, and interesting reports with charts. As such, it offers more features than the usual Todo App. 

Budgeting app is a showcase project that demonstrates important decisions in architecture and development of a modern React application.

Feel free to use it as a reference app or a starter kit.

## Key concepts:

- [x] [PRPL pattern](https://www.slideshare.net/grgur/prpl-pattern-with-webpack-and-react) with minimal application core
- [x] Automatic code splitting with React Router 4 and `import()` statement
- [x] Automatic common chunk bundling
- [x] CSS modules
- [x] Snapshot testing with Jest
- [x] Flow static typing. Check out this [guide to using Flow in the project](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/budgeting-sample-app-webpack2/blob/master/docs/flow.md).

## Performance

_The app loads in 1 second on 3G, cache disabled_

Budgeting app is **blazing fast**, thanks to the smart architecture and Webpack 3 configuration. It takes about 1000ms (1s) to load on 3G (see above).

_Emerging Markets 3G Filmstrip_

The [aggressive test](https://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=170501_0S_XQ5-r:2-c:0) above shows the budgeting app loads in under 5 seconds. It's a heavily limited connection that accounts for poor connectivity and limited bandwidth. 

![Waterfall](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/733074/25586623/676a378a-2ea0-11e7-9342-c040751b6ec6.png)

All important (aka critical path) assets are loaded as early as possible, while the others (e.g. images or GitHub buttons) will load after the first render.

#### How did we get that performance?

1. **Minimal application core.** We decided to ditch the usual convention of creating a vendor chunk. Instead, it's bundled in the app core. The app core is actually very small, containing just the code needed to bootstrap the app.
2. **Common code is a chunk.** We let Webpack figure out which bundles we reuse in chunks and create a common chunk that's also asyncronous. 
3. **Redux module injection**. Each chunk contains respective views _and_ redux modules. Yes, that means reducers, action creators, actions - are all dynamically injected as we navigate through routes. That adds to the _minimal application core_ concept and PRPL pattern. 
4. **H2 Push.** The app is hosted on Firebase and we use the magic of _HTTP2 Push_ to push some of the scripts before they are requested.
5. **Pre-caching**. Service Workers pre-cache resources so the browser can access them as soon as the user needs to.

## Charts
Charts are developed using the awesome D3 library. The idea behind showing charts is not only to show beautiful content, but also to demonstrate keeping heavy content in a chunk that owns it. In other words - we show how applications can run fast even if they use larger libraries.

D3 is used in the `/reports` route only. Given that major routes are separate chunks (code splitting FTW!), the entire D3 library is bundled with the code that needs it. That makes the `/reports` route a bit heavier than the initial `/budget` route, but it also makes routes much faster to load.

## Performance Budgets
We are looking to maintain the lightest possible application core (_aka entry chunk_). Our target is 300kB for the entrypoint and 300kB for all other assets. This is how we set it in [webpack configuration](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/budgeting-sample-app-webpack2/blob/master/webpack.config.js):

```js
performance: {
  maxAssetSize: 300000,
  maxEntrypointSize: 300000,
  hints: 'warning',
},
```

Adding lots of extra code to the entry chunk might cause the build (`yarn run build`) process to show a warning.

_Simulated size warning_

Note that running webpack dev server in production mode (`yarn run prod`) will trigger this warning because of the additional dev server code injected in the app. This code will not show in regular production builds.

## Service Workers
Service workers are enabled only when serving static files, not through webpack-dev-server. Here's how you can test service worker functionality:
1. Run `yarn run build` (or `npm run build`) to build the app
2. Run `yarn run serve` (or `npm run serve`) to serve the app on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. Run a new instance of Chrome with disabled security (because localhost is not on https): 

**OS X**

```bash
open -a "Google Chrome" --args --user-data-dir=/tmp/unsafe --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://localhost
```

**Linux**

```bash
/path/to/chrome --user-data-dir=/tmp/unsafe --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://localhost
```

**Windows**

```bash
chrome.exe --user-data-dir=c:\temp --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://localhost
```

4. Now you can observe network traffic in the Network tab or SW activity in Application > Service Workers in Developer Tools
